LetsGrowMore is a Community which offers various internship programmes, LGM Summer of code, Code Heist contest and many more opportunities to students. It is a notable platform to gain knowledge with real world projects that are done in the industry.

Goal of Let’s Grow More:

The goal is to help others to gain personal and professional skills in the area of Technological development. The purpose is to provide a structure through which students may exercise their right to freely associate in pursuit of a common purpose or goal that enhances community at LetsGrowMore. 

Data Science task:

There were 10 tasks in total ranging from Beginners level, Intermediate level to advance level. Out of these, we were asked to complete at least 4 tasks for an internship certificate and all the 10 tasks for a Letter of Recommendation.

By performing some of the tasks that it asked us to do helped me in developing my skills and problem solving, helped me learn how to approach the problem through different methods and also taught me to implement new features. The versatility of domain in tasks helped to gain knowledge in different fields and aspects of the same mega domain.

Completed 4 tasks that are listed below :

	1. Task 2 - Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM
	2. Task 3 - Music Recommendation Using Random Forest and XGboost
	3. Task 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism
	4. Task 6 - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Networking to Grow:

I was able to connect with number of people in LGM community who were equally dedicated as me towards their projects and helped us exchange our ideas with each other.

I would like to thank Aman Kesarwani and LetsGrowMore for this wonderful opportunity which has helped me to learn and grow. This experience would help me to het more and more involved in Data Science Projects and would have a great impact on my future endeavors.
